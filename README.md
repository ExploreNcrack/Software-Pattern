# Software-Pattern

## Description of Pattern
Patterns are usually described using a format that includes the following information:
* A description of the problem that includes a concrete example and a solution to the concrete problem
* A summary of the forces that lead to the formulation of a general solution
* A general solution 
* The consequences, good and bad, of using the given solution to solve a problem 
* List of related patterns


## UML 
The Unified Modeling Language(UML) is a notation that you can use for object-oriented analysis and desgin.

### Class Diagram
A class diagram is a diagram that shows classes, interfaces, and their relationships.
In the design of a system, a number of classes are identified and grouped together in a class diagram that helps to determine the static relations between them. With detailed modelling, the classes of the conceptual design are often split into a number of subclasses.
#### Structure
</br>The most basic element of a class diagram is a class
</br>Classes are drawn as rectangles. 
</br>The rectangles can be divide into two or three compartments. 
* The top compartment contains the name of the class. 
* The middle compartment lists the class's variables. 
* The bottom compartment lists the class's methods.

**The variable in the middle compartment is indicated as-->   visibilityIndicator name : type**

#### Visibility indicators
</br>The symbols that precede each variable and method are visibility indicators.
</br>There are three different types of **visibility indicators**.
* private(-)
* public(+)
* protected(#)
* Derived(can be combined with one of the others)(/)
* Package(~)
* Random(*)
#### Scope
The UML specifies two types of scope for members: **instance and classifier**, and the latter is represented by underlined names.
